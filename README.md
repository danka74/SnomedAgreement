# SnomedAgreement

A set of R script files for calculating agreement measures when SNOMED CT codes are used.

These script files make use of the agreement functions provided by Kilem Gwet: http://www.agreestat.com/r_functions.html

The script requires access to some database containing a transitive closure table including descendants count.
